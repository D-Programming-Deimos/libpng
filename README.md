libpng
======

D bindings to libpng.

Seems suitable for inclusion into the larger set of bindings offered by the Deimos project.

These bindings were miticulously created by hand, based on the C headers from libpng 
version 1.6.16 - December 22, 2014.

The repo is following the usual 'dub' structure, but you don't need 'dub' to use it.
You can simply copy the libpng folder to your import path.
